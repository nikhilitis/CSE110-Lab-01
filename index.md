# Nikhil Rao: User Page

**Hi, my name is Nikhil Rao.**
I am a fourth year Computer Science: Bioinformatics major at UCSD.

From not understanding how `"Hello world"` is to be printed to writing complex programs in software engineering internships, I fell as though I have come a long way in my journey as a student.

One of my favorite lessons that I learned about programming during my first year at UCSD was:
> The program will do exactly what you tell it to do, not what you want it to do.

This lesson has helped me a lot in understanding how my code could potentially be failing and troubleshooting my issues.

So far, my favorite courses in the Computer Science department at UCSD, in no order, have been:
- CSE 8B
- CSE 101
- CSE 105

I can't wait to learn more about software engineering in CSE 110. The skills I want to improve on through this course, from most to least important, are:
1. Analytical thinking
2. Leadership
3. Stress tolerance and flexibility

The stages of software development I'm eager to work on are:
- [ ] Designing the project solution
- [ ] Coding the software implementation
- [ ] Putting the project into operation
